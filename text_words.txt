Build in React instead of Flask
Flask is an awesome framework – all you really need to do is understand Python to get your first project up and running. Most of the time, you use templates to render HTML files.

If you’re new to web development, I recommend you to draw a mockup of the web application you want to build – using boxes – so that you can see everything that you'll soon code. For example, your mockup should have a lot of boxes – one for each potential component and prop you want to have.

Keep in mind that props - which stands for properties - are similar to variables because they are used to pass data into a component. It might be best to think of props like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

Start a React app
In React, there are a few different ways to start a React application. For the sake of simplicity, we'll use a shortcut command to build out the project structure that you can build on.

Building React projects with a background in Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS
Congratulations, hope it wasn't too bad moving from a Flask app to a React app! As you can see, there are only a few syntax changes. Instead of having Flask render the HTML pages and Python functions for your web application, you use React's handy technologies to kickstart your application’s UI.

It's worth noting that in a practical application, you should not explicitly write the data in a list or template as it could interfere with the HTML markup. A workaround would be to use a loop to pass in the data. This would overall give you a nicer structure - whether you're working in Flask or React!
